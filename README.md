<h1 align="center">Piscine_42</h1>

This repo is a global snapshot of my piscine, during July 2023 at 42 Perpignan.

![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/rainbow.png)

The "Piscine" is a 4 weeks admission test , consisting in learning basic CS skills such as using a VSC, Shell commands and scripting and of course good old C.

My log time was a bit distorded for various network reasons. My log time was between 10 and 12h a day.

Thoses directories contains tests I wrote myself (for the most part).

// DISCLAIMER //

From now, do not rely much on the exercices themselves, as they didn't went through the moulinette !

This repo is, for now, here mostly for the test !


This repo will be updated when I'll start 42, with my scores and stuff !

Feel free to create pull requests and issues if you see something that can be improved, I'll be happy to merge/fix them !
