The "Piscine" is a 4 weeks admission test , consisting in learning basic CS skills such as using a VCS, Shell commands and scripting and of course good old C.

Despite being distorded by various reasons (mostly because I forgot to logout quite often), my log time was on average between 10 and 12h per day.

I ended up with level 9.

I did from c_00 to c_08, boths shells and all rushes. Did not make BSQ.

shell_00 is all about discovering basic shell commands and getting familiar with it, ssh printing, and exploring authorisations.
